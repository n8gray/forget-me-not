Notes:

Prefpane documentation:

On debugging the preference pane:
    The output from FMN.app will go to console.log (use Console.app to monitor it.)

Handy page on loading code in bundles:

Preference panes are exactly 595 pixels wide, with varying height.

The image on the cinema display in the prefs pane is 139x87 pixels and the 
macbook pro's image is 90x57 pixels.

To create the miniFlower.tiff file, I changed the stroke width of all the outer
(petal) lines to 3px and exported the page to a 32x32 bitmap.  That makes the 
lines darker in the 32x32 icon, which is a good thing.  For the 128x128 size, I
left the width unchanged.

Things that still bug n8:

* The "launch at login" preference doesn't require FMN to be running, so we
  shouldn't disable it when FMN isn't running.

* We may want to let the user decide how display configurations are matched.
  For example, one strategy is to only use display size.  In this case, moving
  displays wouldn't change the match.  On the other end of the spectrum, another
  strategy is to only match if the monitors are identical in make, model, size,
  and position.  The default strategy, IMHO, should be "only use size".
